<p>Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost entirely 
superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though not so durable 
as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic; and I will add (since 
there is an aesthetics in all things), is much more handsome and becoming 
to the boat, than hemp. Hemp is a dusky, dark fellow, a sort of Indian; but 
Manilla is as a golden-haired Circassian to behold.</p>

<p>The whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness. At first sight, you 
would not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment its one and fifty 
yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds; so 
that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons. In length, 
the common sperm whale-line measures something over two hundred 
fathoms. Towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub, 
not like the worm-pipe of a still though, but so as to form one round, 
cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded "sheaves," or layers of concentric 
spiralizations, without any hollow but the "heart," or minute vertical tube
formed at the axis of the cheese. </p>

<p>Soon all the boats but Starbuck's were dropped; all the boat-sails set all the 
paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to leeward; and Ahab 
heading the onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up Fedallah's sunken eyes; a 
hideous motion. The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp 
slightly vapoured with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of 
ordinary ropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp more 
pliable to the rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself more convenient 
to the sailor for common ship use; yet, not only would the ordinary quantity 
too much stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling to which it must be 
subjected; but as most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in general by no 
means adds to the rope's durability or strength, however much it may give 
it compactness and gloss.</p>

<p>Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an eye-
splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub, and 
hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything. This 
arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts. First: In order 
to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat, 
in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off 
the entire line originally attached to the harpoon. In these instances, the 
whale of courseis shifted like a mug of ale, as it were, from the one boat to 
the other; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort. 
Second: This arrangement is indispensable for common safety's sake.
As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would, in running out, infallibly take 
somebody's arm, leg, or entire body off, the utmost precaution is used in 
stowing the line in its tub. Some harpooneers will consume almost an entire 
morning in this business, carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it 
downwards through a block towards the tub, so as in the act of coiling to 
free it from all possible wrinkles and twists.</p>
